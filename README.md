## Observer Pattern

### The Observer Pattern defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.


Advantages of loosely coupled
1.	The subject known about an observer is that it implements a certain interface (the Observer interface).
2.	We can add new observers at any time.
3.	We never need to modify the subject to add new types of observers.
4.	We can reuse subjects or observers independently of each other.
5.	Changes to either the subject or an observer will not affect the other.
